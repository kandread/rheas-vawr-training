#+TITLE: RHEAS Training for SERVIR-ADPC/VAWR
#+AUTHOR: Kostas Andreadis
#+OPTIONS: author:nil date:nil

This document conatins a narrative for the [[https://github.com/nasa/RHEAS][RHEAS]] training at ADPC and VAWR.
* Installation
In this training, we will be using the [[https://github.com/kandread/RHEAS-docker][RHEAS Docker]] image. Assuming that you have installed the [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] software following the instructions (for [[https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/][Windows]] and [[https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/][Mac]]), we start by initializing the PostGIS database service in a terminal window
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker-compose up -d
#+END_SRC
Depending on whether you want to pull the Docker image from the internet or from the local directory, you can do the following for the latter case before you run the above command
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker load < rheas.latest.tar.gz
docker load < postgis_9.6.tar.gz
#+END_SRC
We now have a RHEAS container ready to run! Let's set an alias so we're able to call ~rheas~ without typing too much
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
alias rheas='docker-compose run rheas bin/rheas'
#+END_SRC
The final step is ingesting a prepared database image to our container
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker-compose run rheas 'pg_restore -d rheas /data/vawrdb'
#+END_SRC
* Setting up the QGIS plugin
Assuming that you have installed version 3 of [[https://qgis.org/en/site/][QGIS]], you can click on the ~Plugins~ → ~Manage and Install Plugins...~ → ~Install from ZIP~ and select the [[https://github.com/kandread/RHEAS-qgis][RHEAS-qgis]] zip file. Before installing the plugin though we need to create the connection to the RHEAS Docker database.
Under the ~Browser~ panel, right-click on the PostGIS entry and select ~New connection~. A dialog box will open up where you can input the following entries

* Acquiring datasets
The database in the Docker image already has meteorological data ingested including
- CHIRPS and GPM precipitation
- NCEP reanalysis air temperature and wind speed
Now let's see download some soil moisture data from the SMOS satellite. We have to write a configuration file ~data.conf~
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[domain]
minlat: 8.5
maxlat: 23.4
minlon: 102.1
maxlon: 109.4

[smos]
startdate: 2017-4-1
enddate: 2017-6-30
#+END_EXAMPLE
and then run ~rheas~ with
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rheas -v -u /data/data.conf
#+END_SRC
* Running a hydrologic nowcast
We will perform a nowcast simulation by writing another configuration file ~nowcast.conf~
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[nowcast]
model: vic
startdate: 2016-1-1
enddate: 2016-12-31
basin: /data/shapefiles/vnm0.shp
name: vawr
resolution: 0.25

[vic]
precip: chirps
temperature: ncep
wind: ncep
save: runoff, cdi
#+END_EXAMPLE
and then executing
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rheas -v /data/nowcast.conf
#+END_SRC
* Running a hydrologic ensemble nowcast
Apart from the CHIRPS precipitation data, the database also contains GPM precipitation data for a shorter period. This allows us to perform a stochastic simulation that represents the uncertainty from the different precipitation datasets.
The ~nowcast.conf~ now becomes
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[nowcast]
model: vic
startdate: 2016-1-1
enddate: 2016-1-31
basin: /data/shapefiles/vnm0.shp
name: vawr
resolution: 0.25

[vic]
precip: chirps, gpm
temperature: ncep
wind: ncep
save to: db
save: runoff
#+END_EXAMPLE
which we can then run as
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rheas -v /data/nowcast.conf
#+END_SRC
* Assimilating satellite observations
We can now ingest additional satellite information by assimilating the SMOS soil moisture observations.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[nowcast]
model: vic
startdate: 2017-4-1
enddate: 2017-4-3
basin: /data/shapefiles/vnm0.shp
name: vawr
resolution: 0.25

[vic]
precip: chirps
temperature: ncep
wind: ncep
save to: db
save: runoff
observations: smos
#+END_EXAMPLE
We can run the nowcast similarly to before
#+BEGIN_SRC 
rheas -v /data/nowcast.conf
#+END_SRC
* Running a hydrologic forecast
A forecast can be run similarly to a nowcast by also selecting a method (ESP or NMME) to generate the ensemble with the ~forecast.conf~ containing
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[forecast]
model: vic
startdate: 2016-1-1
enddate: 2016-3-31
basin: /data/shapefiles/VNM_adm0.shp
name: vawr
resolution: 0.25
ensemble size: 2
method: esp

[vic]
precip: chirps
temperature: ncep
wind: ncep
save to: db
save: runoff
#+END_EXAMPLE
and
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rheas -v /data/forecast.conf
#+END_SRC
* Running an agricultural nowcast
We can modify the ~nowcast.conf~ by adding "dssat" in the ~model~ keyword, and some parameters for the DSSAT model.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[nowcast]
model: vic, dssat
startdate: 2016-1-1
enddate: 2016-12-31
basin: /data/shapefiles/vnm0.shp
name: vawr
resolution: 0.25

[vic]
precip: chirps
temperature: ncep
wind: ncep
save to: db
save: runoff, cdi

[dssat]
shapefile: /data/shapefiles/vnm0.shp
ensemble size: 40
assimilate: off
crop: rice
#+END_EXAMPLE
Unless we explicitly set the required output variables when running VIC (rainfall, soil moisture, net radiative fluxes, air temperature), we need to run both models to have RHEAS automatically generate them. A ~dssat~ table will be created under the simulation schema (~vawr~ in this example) conatining the time series of yield, LAI and water stress as well as a ~yield~ table containing the crop yield during harvest.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rheas -v /data/nowcast.conf
#+END_SRC
* Running an agricultural forecast
Similarly to the agricultural nowcast, we can run a forecast by modifying the ~forecast.conf~ file
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[forecast]
model: vic, dssat
startdate: 2016-1-1
enddate: 2016-3-31
basin: /data/shapefiles/vnm0.shp
name: vawr
resolution: 0.25
ensemble size: 2
method: esp

[vic]
precip: chirps
temperature: ncep
wind: ncep
save to: db
save: runoff

[dssat]
shapefile: /data/shapefiles/vnm0.shp
ensemble size: 40
assimilate: off
crop: rice
#+END_EXAMPLE
and running
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rheas -v /data/forecast.conf
#+END_SRC
* Impact of agricultural management practices
* Analysis of crop productivity
* Topics for discussion
- Interface for DSSAT inputs (fertilizer, irrigation, cultivars)
- Implementation of 5-km simulations in terms of computing requirements
- What are the priorities for ADPC and VAWR during the final year of the SERVIR project?
